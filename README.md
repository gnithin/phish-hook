TODO:

## NOTES:
- Going with building an extension with Chrome, since there's a lot of literature about it. Should ideally work with all Chromium based browsers. Need to test it out later.
- Following this - https://css-tricks.com/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension/
- There are a lot of boilerplates already available, but trying the basic thing out first. If it gets tougher, will use a boiler-plate (Our use-case is not convoluted).
